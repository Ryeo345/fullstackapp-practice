/* MAIN PROBLEM
It was easier to do with one table , but adding the 2nd data model, the querying and gather of the data
became more difficult.

I wanted to have the form at the bottom of the details page to add another <li> item in the subscriptions
portion of the details page.

I'm not sure if its an issue with my seeded data for the subscriptions table in the db/index.js, but I had to end up hard
coding the data on the SubcriptionCreate.js for the data to work

The react doesn't not render after I create a new subscription on the details page
*/

/* SIDE PROBLEMS
things still need to be done
1. add total state to calculate to total expenses for the combined subscriptions
2. modify the data models so no person can have duplicate subscriptions
3. fix css
